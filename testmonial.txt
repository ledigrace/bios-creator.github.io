One of the laptops that I repaired had a problem with the auto-on and no display issues. Bioscreator just made my laptop repairing easier.

I quickly fixed the on/off display using the bin file in Bioscreator. Participating in the LeakyMosfet training, joining the forum, and using Bioscreator were all very helpful to me as a laptop technician.
